**Comparing Music Preferences: Springfield vs. Shelbyville 🎶**

**Overview 📊**
In the world of data, decisions are only as good as the insights behind them. Businesses thrive when they question assumptions and validate them with data. This project dives into user behavior data from Yandex.Music to uncover patterns and answer key hypotheses about music preferences in two cities: Springfield and Shelbyville.

**Objective 🎯**
We aim to test three hypotheses that could reveal how user behavior differs based on location and time:

User activity varies depending on the day of the week and the city.
On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. The same is true for Friday nights.
Springfield listeners prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more fans of rap.
Dataset 📂
The data on user behavior is stored in /datasets/music_project_en.csv. However, no information is provided about its quality. This means the dataset will require careful examination and preprocessing to address any potential issues before we dive into the analysis.

**Project Workflow 🛠️**
The project is divided into three main stages:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Describe and understand the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and other quality issues to ensure reliable results.
Hypothesis Testing: Use statistical methods to validate or reject the hypotheses and draw meaningful conclusions.

**Why This Matters 💡**
Understanding user behavior isn’t just about numbers—it’s about uncovering trends and insights that drive business decisions. Through this project, we’ll showcase the power of data analysis in solving real-world problems while demonstrating technical skills in Python, data cleaning, and statistical hypothesis testing.
